When started, service manager creates: [$STATEDIR/svcname], where svcname
is the basename of the folder being launched.

STATEDIR is set as follows, in order of priority:
    1. Read from $HOME/.rundrc (ignored if -s is set)
    2. Read from $(sysconfdir)/rund.conf (if available)
    3. $(runstatedir)/$(basename-argv0)/$USER(EUID)

The process load information is read from: [$STATEDIR/svcname], where svcname
is the basename of the folder being launched.
